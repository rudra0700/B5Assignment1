### Q : Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.
<hr>
<p>
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds optional static typing and other powerful features to the language.It compiles (or "transpiles") down to plain JavaScript, which means you can run the output in any browser, Node.js, or JS environment.
</p>
<p>And **any, unknown  and never** types is one of the main feature in typscript</p>

###  Understanding any, unknown, and never in TypeScript :
<hr>
<p>When working with TypeScript, you'll come across some special types that can be confusing at first</p>
<br>
Let’s break them down in plain language with examples : 

 ## any - The “turn off TypeScript” type**
It disables all type checking for that variable.

```ts
let value: any = "Hello";
value = 123;
value = true;
```
 **⚠️ Avoid using any unless you absolutely need to!**
<hr>

## unknown – Like any, but safer
<p>
unknown means: “I don’t know what this is yet, but please check before using it.”
</p>
<p>
You must check the type before doing anything with it.
</p>

```ts
let value: unknown = "Hello";

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe
}
```

 **✅ Use unknown when working with dynamic or external data (e.g., API responses), and you want type safety**

 <hr>

 ## never – Represents values that never happen
 <p>
  never is used when a function never returns or a condition is impossible.
 </p>

 ```ts
 function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
```

<hr>

### Q.  How TypeScript Improves Code Quality & Project Maintainability?

<p>
 1. TypeScript isn't just "JavaScript with types" — it’s a powerful tool that helps teams write cleaner, safer, and easier-to-maintain code.
 TypeScript checks your code before it runs. This means you catch mistakes like typos, missing properties, or wrong function arguments at compile time, not in production.
</p>


```ts
function greet(name: string) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

greet(123); // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to 'string'
```
<hr>

<p>
2. Better Autocomplete & IntelliSense
When you use TypeScript, your editor (like VSCode) knows the exact structure of your code — so you get helpful suggestions, faster coding, and fewer bugs.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
 3. Clearer Code with Self-Documentation
Type annotations act like documentation. When you define a type or interface, anyone reading the code knows what’s expected.
</p>

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

function printUser(user: User) {
  console.log(user.name);
}
```
<hr>
<p>
5. Scales Well in Teams
When working in a team, TypeScript helps ensure everyone is on the same page, reducing bugs and confusion across files and developers.
